            <p>At the heart of my design philosophy lies the belief that design should be inclusive, expressive, and above all, joyful. I strive to break away from conventional norms and embrace a more playful approach that celebrates individuality and diversity. My work often incorporates bold colors, unexpected contrasts, and whimsical elements that invite viewers to engage with their imagination.</p>
            <p className="second">Drawing from a queer headspace, I bring a fresh perspective to modern design by infusing it with a sense of liberation and authenticity. For me, design is not just about aesthetics, but about creating meaningful connections and sparking joy in the everyday. A big part of my work at Goddex was creating tiny pieces of art for people to have in their homes at all price levels, infusing everyday items with moments of joy or introspection.</p>
            <p>When approaching a new project, I immerse myself in understanding the client’s vision while staying true to my core values of creativity and inclusivity. A client may not like bold colors, and that’s okay! I believe in collaborative storytelling, where every design element—from typography to color palette—contributes to a cohesive narrative that resonates with the audience and the client. This approach allows me to adapt to diverse projects, whether it’s designing a brand identity, conceptualizing digital experiences, or bringing text to life on stage.</p>
            <p className="second">
            In essence, my design journey is a celebration of diversity, creativity, and the transformative power of imagination. By embracing flexibility alongside fun and whimsy, I aspire to create designs that not only captivate but also adapt effortlessly to varying contexts and client needs.
